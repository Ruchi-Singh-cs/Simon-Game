# Simon-Game
The Simon Game is a fun memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Players have to repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors. With each level, the sequence gets longer, testing memory and focus skills.

ðŸš€ How to Play

Press the Start button (or any key, if implemented).

Watch the sequence of colors carefully.

Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.

Each round, a new color is added to the sequence.

Keep going as long as you can â€“ one wrong move and the game is over!
